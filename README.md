# Grade Tracker
Track your grades in numerous courses with weighted assignment categories

The launching screen of this android app is the CourseCatalogActivity which displays your list of courses.
Courses are added to the list in the CourseEditorActivity which can be accessed through the Floating Action Button.
Existing courses can be edited or deleted by long-pressing the desired course from the list.

Clicking a course on the list opens the AssignmentCatalogActivity, which displays the course summary (weighted
grades for each category as well as for the overall course) and a list of assignments. Assignments and grades
can be added through the Floating Action Button in this activity.

Deleting can be done through overflow menus in each activity.
